want what do we want we want women thats it its the only thing we know for sure it really is we want women how do we get them oh we dont know bout that we dont know the next step after that we have no idea this is why you see men honking carhorns yelling from construction sites these are the best ideas weve had so far the carhorn honk is that a beauty have you seen men doing this what is this the man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks eeeehh eehhh eehhh this man is out of ideas how does it eeeeeeehhhh i dont think she likes me the amazing thing is that we still get women dont we men i mean men are with women you see men with women how are men getting women many people wonder let me tell you a little bit about our organization wherever women are we have a man working on the situation right now now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene thats why i think men get frustrated when we see women

<newline> JERRY: you shrunk it you know you shrunk it just tell me that you shrunk it <newline> CLEANER: looks around making sure not too many people are listening i shrunk it <newline> JERRY: i think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner well its ruined and of course the dry cleaner can respond its not our fault were not responsible we just ruin the clothes that ends our legal obligation you see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible thright theyre cleaning our clothes but theyre not getting anything wet its all dry i know theres gotta be some liquids back there some fluids that theyre using theres no such thing as dry cleaning when you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that jerry brushes off his shirt thats dry cleaning i dont think thats what theyre doing back there they dont have eighty guys going come on hurry up theres a lot of shirts

for me to ask a woman out i gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks so lloyd calls me a wuss <newline> JERRY: he said wuss <newline> GEORGE: yeah anyway he shamed me into it <newline> JERRY: so you called <newline> GEORGE: right and and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone it makes you sound casual <newline> JERRY: yeah like a farm boy <newline> GEORGE: right so i call her up i tell her its me she gives me an enthusiastic hi <newline> JERRY: wow the enthusiastic hi thats beautiful <newline> GEORGE: oh i dont get the enthusiastic hi im outta there <newline> JERRY: all right so youre chewing your apple you got your enthusiastic hi go ahead <newline> GEORGE: so

bought <newline> JERRY: great day in the morning <newline> GEORGE: then i got off the phone right away <newline> JERRY: sure its like robbing a bank you dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money you come in you hit and get out <newline> GEORGE: its amazing we we both have dates on the same night i cant remember the last time that happened <newline> GEORGE: i cant stand doing laundry thats why i have forty pairs of underwear <newline> CAROL: you do not <newline> GEORGE: absolutely because instead of doing a wash i just keep buying underwear my goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair that way i only have to do wash once a year <newline> JERRY: in an attempted scottish accent come on try it let me hear you try a scottish accent <newline> DONNA:

is being painted <newline> JERRY: oh thats okay <newline> DONNA: unless you want to go to your place <newline> JERRY: okay but theres no cake or anything if thats what youre looking for <newline> GEORGE: frustrated take it easy huh take it easy <newline> JERRY: i think if ones going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note its common courtesy i dont know thats just the way i was brought up <newline> DONNA: values are very important <newline> JERRY: oh so important so what are you doing uh thursday night you wanna have dinner <newline> DONNA: thursdays great <newline> JERRY: tan pants why do i buy tan pants donna i dont feel comfortable in them <newline> DONNA: are those cotton dockers <newline> JERRY: oh i cant begin to tell you how much i hate that commercial <newline> DONNA: really i like that commercial <newline> JERRY: you like that commercial <newline> DONNA: yeah its clever <newline> JERRY: now wait a second you mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty <newline> DONNA: yeah thats the one <newline> JERRY: what could you possibly like about that <newline> DONNA: i dont know i like the guys <newline> JERRY: yeah theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other and i could be comfortable too if i had pants like that i could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session <newline> JERRY: even if the dialogue did ring true donna starts to get annoyed that jerry wont let the conversation go even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that what does that have to do with the pants doesnt that bother you <newline> DONNA: annoyed thats the idea thats whats clever about it that theyre not talking about the pants <newline> JERRY: but theyre talking about nothing
