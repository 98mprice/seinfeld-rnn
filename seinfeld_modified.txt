want what do we want we want women thats it its the only thing we know for sure it really is we want women how do we get them oh we dont know bout that we dont know the next step after that we have no idea this is why you see men honking carhorns yelling from construction sites these are the best ideas weve had so far the carhorn honk is that a beauty have you seen men doing this what is this the man is in the car the woman walks by the front of the car he honks eeeehh eehhh eehhh this man is out of ideas how does it eeeeeeehhhh i dont think she likes me the amazing thing is that we still get

working on the situation right now now he may not be our best man okay we have a lot of areas to cover but someone from our staff is on the scene thats why i think men get frustrated when we see women

<newline> JERRY: you shrunk it you know you shrunk it just tell me that you shrunk it <newline> CLEANER: looks around making sure not too many people are listening i shrunk it <newline> JERRY: i think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so i can say to the dry cleaner well its ruined and of course the dry cleaner can respond its not our fault were not responsible we just ruin the clothes that ends our legal obligation you see the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible thright theyre cleaning our clothes but theyre not getting anything wet its all dry i know theres gotta be some liquids back there some fluids that theyre using theres no such thing as dry cleaning when you get something on your shirt ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that jerry brushes off his shirt thats dry cleaning i dont think thats what theyre doing back there they dont have eighty guys going come on hurry up theres a lot of shirts

shamed me into it <newline> JERRY: so you called <newline> GEORGE: right and and to cover my nervousness i started eating an apple because i think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the

hi thats beautiful <newline> GEORGE: oh i dont get the enthusiastic hi im outta there <newline> JERRY: all right so youre chewing your apple you got your enthusiastic hi go ahead <newline> GEORGE: so

bought <newline> JERRY: great day in the morning <newline> GEORGE: then i got off the phone right away <newline> JERRY: sure its like robbing a bank you dont loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money you come in you hit and get out <newline> GEORGE: its amazing we we both have dates on the same night i cant remember the last time that happened <newline> GEORGE: i cant stand doing laundry thats why i have forty pairs of underwear <newline> CAROL: you do not <newline> GEORGE: absolutely because instead of doing a wash i just keep buying underwear my goal is to have

GEORGE: frustrated take it easy huh take it easy <newline> JERRY: i think if ones going to kill oneself the least you could do is leave a note its common courtesy i dont know thats just the way i was brought up <newline> DONNA: values are very important <newline> JERRY: oh so important so what are you doing uh thursday night you wanna have dinner <newline> DONNA: thursdays great <newline> JERRY:

DONNA: really i like that commercial <newline> JERRY: you like that commercial <newline> DONNA: yeah its clever <newline> JERRY: now wait a second you mean the one where the guys are all standing around supposedly being very casual and witty <newline> DONNA: yeah thats the one <newline> JERRY: what could you possibly like about that <newline> DONNA: i dont know i like the guys <newline> JERRY: yeah theyre so funny and so comfortable with each other and i could be comfortable too if i had pants like that i could sit on a porch and wrestle around and maybe even be part of a real bull session

hundred feet came down right on my head cracked it wide open blood and stuff was just splattered all over the road therei broke every bone in my face hey you know when they found me my eyes were

into kramers now you want to go into elainesshe entrusted me with her spare keys how can i just let you in <newline> JERRY: what is the big deal <newline> GEORGE: just because you have someones spare keys it doesnt entitle you to break into their apartment thats the reason you took away kramers keys <newline> JERRY: first of all youre not even supposed to have elaines keys youre supposed to give em back to her so she can give em back to me because she has mine so technically those are my keys <newline> GEORGE: yes well if you had never taken your keys back from kramer he never would have taken his back from you and given em to me in which case i wouldnt have had to take mine back from her <newline> JERRY: well i want those keys tries to grab the keys from george <newline> GEORGE: nope

that when she gave you yours you didnt give her hers cause then she would have given em to me because she has mine so then i would have never had to ask you for hers so that i could get mine <newline>

the university level like where freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you thats the kind of help you need not the once a week for eighty bucks no you need a team a team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you having conferences observing you like the way they did with the elephant man thats what im talking about because thats the only way youre going to get better <newline> GEORGE:  i thought the woman was kind of cute <newline> JERRY: hold it i really want to be clear about this are you talking about the woman in the meeting is that

the words as mr ross says them cherish the cabin not uh take care of your sister adding shes a paraplegic but cherish the cabin smiling reflecting and i have for 45 years its often been a sanctuary

ii want to see the pigman show me the pig man <newline> KRAMER: oh dont worry im gonna show you and youll never be the same <newline> JERRY: maybe hes just a guy with a nose like this holds his nose up like a pig you know a lot of people have a nose like this theyre not necessarily pigmen <newline> KRAMER: believe me jerry somewhere in this hospital the anguished oink of pigman cries out for help

they thought he was flying you know how children are oh look a man is flying a man is flying and then splat <newline> GEORGE: thats where i come in umm on splat uh you see mrs sweedler or is it hospital administrator sweedler <newline> SWEEDLER: mrs sweedlers fine <newline> GEORGE: mrs sweedler thank you yyou see this tragedy affected me in a very very personal way <newline> SWEEDLER: how is that <newline> GEORGE: yes well you see the deceased landed on my car the uh splat as it were actually occurred on the roof of my car now of course i cant help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but ive never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible what with the baldness and everything <newline> SWEEDLER: well i have known bald men who owned convertibles they wore a hat <newline> GEORGE: yes but then everything is all pulled down and its jus anyway the damage unfortunately has marred an otherwise fine automobile rendering it virtually undriveable <newline> SWEEDLER: stiffening yes well that is a shame <newline> GEORGE: yes a shame that is exactly how i would put it now mrs sweedler with all due discretion and sensitivity and taking in the whole scope of the situation i just cant help but think that the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other still living victim of horrendous horrendous tragedy <newline> SWEEDLER: mrconstanza <newline> GEORGE: yes <newline> SWEEDLER: a man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise  <newline> GEORGE: yes <newline> SWEEDLER:  and you greedily callously want to profit from it <newline> GEORGE: pulling out estimate out of his pocket well profit i think youll see from the estimate that im not really profiting that much they might be a little high but <newline>

braun who is believed to be responsible for the name tag fiasco we now take you to giuliani headquarters where rudy giuliani is about to make a statement <newline> GIULIANI: its hard to understand

the newspaper apparently some blood spilled into mr giulianis test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported ironically the mishap by bringing the nonfat

amsterdam avenue according to pinkus wife gendeson had been involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray sansabelt slacks we also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper at vancourtlands golf course saw an irate gendeson leaving the clubhouse in a huff whether there is a possible connection between the two is something well just have to wait <newline> KRAMER: jerry  <newline> JERRY: well it has nothing to do with you <newline> KRAMER: yeah but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he murdered the dry cleaner <newline> JERRY: well

but its no big deal <newline> ELAINE: you want the money for the big salad george <newline> GEORGE: no no <newline> ELAINE: what is the problem <newline> GEORGE: there is no problem just a small

board and we can get to work now whats it going to be <newline> GEORGE: all right dammit im in <newline> JERRY: i couldnt do it without you <newline> GEORGE: all right lets get to work <newline>

sandy that i want to have a meacutenage agrave trois with her and her roommate <newline> GEORGE: thats right <newline> JERRY: and you believe this course of action will have a twopronged effect firstly the very mention of the idea will cause sandy to recoil in disgust whereupon she will insist that i remove myself from the premises <newline> GEORGE: keep going <newline> JERRY: at this point it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events <newline> GEORGE: continue <newline> JERRY: the roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request <newline> GEORGE: a few days go by and a call is placed at a time when sandy is known to be busy at work once the initial awkwardness is relieved with a little playful humor which she laura of course cannot resist an invitation to a friendly dinner is proffered <newline> JERRY: huh well it all sounds pretty good theres only one flaw in it theyre roommates shed have to go out with me behind sandys back shes not gonna do that <newline> GEORGE: you disappoint me my friend sandy wants
